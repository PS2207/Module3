# Problem 1: Understanding AI and ML
Relationship (in one line):
AI is the broad goal of making machines act intelligently. ML is a subset of AI where systems learn patterns from data instead of being explicitly programmed with rules (and Deep Learning is a further subset of ML that uses neural networks with many layers).

Why ML instead of traditional (rule-based) programming?
Use ML when patterns are too complex for hand-written rules, 
the data is high-dimensional (text, images, audio), or the environment changes over time so the system must adapt by retraining.

# Two real-world examples (with justification):
- Email spam detection
  Why not rules? Spammers constantly change wording and tricks—hard to keep rule lists up to date.
  Why ML? A model can learn subtle, non-linear patterns from millions of emails and adapt as new data arrives (concept drift).

- Image recognition (e.g., recognizing handwritten digits or objects in photos)
  Why not rules? You can’t hand-code stable rules for all shapes, fonts, sizes, lighting, and noise.
  Why ML? Models (e.g., CNNs) learn features automatically from pixels and handle the complexity and variability far better than manual rules.

Problem 2: Supervised vs Unsupervised Learning
Part A — Quick comparison table
Aspect	           Supervised Learning	                                                            Unsupervised Learning
Data requirement	 Inputs with labels/targets (e.g., “spam” vs “not spam”, price value)	            Inputs without labels (just features)
Main goal	         Predict a target: classification or regression	                                  Discover structure: clusters, groups, low-dimensional representations, anomalies
Typical algorithms Linear/Logistic Regression, Decision Trees/Random Forests, SVM, Neural Networks	K-Means/Hierarchical/DBSCAN, PCA, t-SNE/UMAP, Autoencoders, Isolation Forest
Evaluation	       Use a labeled test set: Accuracy, Precision/Recall, F1, AUC, MAE/RMSE	          Use structure/quality scores: Silhouette, Davies–Bouldin, WCSS; visualization; or downstream task performance
Labeling effort  	 High (labels must be created/verified)	                                          Low (no labels needed)
Typical outputs	   A predictive model that maps X → y	                                              Clusters, embeddings, or anomaly scores (no explicit target)
Common use cases	 Spam detection, price prediction, disease diagnosis	                            Customer segmentation, topic discovery, anomaly detection, dimensionality reduction

Part B — Choose supervised vs unsupervised (with reasoning)
Detecting fraudulent credit card transactions → Supervised
If you have historical labeled data (“fraud” vs “legit”), a classifier can learn patterns of fraud. (Imbalanced learning techniques often used.)

Grouping customers based on purchasing behavior → Unsupervised
No ground-truth groups; use clustering to discover natural segments.

Predicting stock prices → Supervised
You have past prices as targets; train a regression/time-series model to predict future values.

Finding anomalies in network traffic → Unsupervised
Anomalies are rare and labels are scarce; use anomaly detection to flag outliers relative to normal traffic.

(Q1)Which routing protocol uses hop count as its metric and is limited to 15 hops?
(a)RIP ✅   (b)OSPF   (c)BGP   (d)EIGRP
RIP (Routing Information Protocol) is a distance-vector routing protocol.
It uses hop count as its metric.
Maximum hop count is 15, making networks with 16 or more hops unreachable.
OSPF → link-state, uses cost based on bandwidth.
BGP → path-vector, uses AS path.
EIGRP → advanced distance-vector, uses multiple metrics (bandwidth, delay, reliability, load).
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(Q2)OSPF chooses the best path based on which algorithm?
(a)Bellman-Ford   (b)Dijkstra SPF ✅   (c)Floyd-Warshall  (d)Kruskal
OSPF (Open Shortest Path First) is a link-state routing protocol.
It uses Dijkstra’s Shortest Path First (SPF) algorithm to compute the shortest path tree and select the best routes.
Bellman-Ford → used by distance-vector protocols like RIP.
Floyd-Warshall → all-pairs shortest path algorithm (not commonly used in routing).
Kruskal → minimum spanning tree algorithm, not used for routing decisions.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(Q3)Which type of routing is manually configured and does not change automatically?
(a)Static Routing  (b)Dynamic Routing  (c)Default Routing  (d)Hybrid Routing
Static Routing → routes are manually configured by the network administrator and do not change automatically.
Dynamic Routing → routes are automatically adjusted using routing protocols like RIP, OSPF, or EIGRP.
Default Routing → a special route used when no specific route is found.
Hybrid Routing → combines features of both distance-vector and link-state protocols.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A language is a set of strings, where each string is a fininte sequence of symbols from an alphabet.
