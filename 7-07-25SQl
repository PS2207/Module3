Table is the basic object in a database that stores data in rows and columns.
Each columns has a specific data type(like INT,VARCHAR,DATE,etc)
You can insert ,update,delete,select data from a table.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Insert data without mentioning column names-
INSERT data INTO students
values(1,'alice',20,'alice@gmail.com');

Insert data by mentioning column names(this is the best practice)-
INSERT data INTO students (id,name,age,email)
values(1,'alice', 20, 'alice@gmail.com');
-------UPDATE-----------------------------------
SYNTAX:
UPDATE table_name 
SET column1=value1,  column2=value2,....
WHERE condition;
EXAMPLE:
UPDATE students
SET name="Bob', email='bob@gmail.com'
WHERE id=1;
-------DELETE------------------------------------
SYNTAX:
DELETE FROM table_name
WHERE CONDITION;
Example:
DELETE FROM students
WHERE age>20;
------------------------------------------
