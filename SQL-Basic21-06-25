Understanding the Data Definition Language(DDL) :
Background & Origin:
SQl was developed at IBM by Donald D.Chamberlin and Raymond F.Boyace after learning about the relational model from Edgar F.chatCodd in the early 1970s.
The language was originally named SEQUEL(Structured English Query Language)
WHat is SQL?

Visual Representation of SQl as the Bridge Between DBMS aand Data   DBMS->SQL->Data

How SQL interacts with Data in a DBMS?
Why is SQL Important?
User friendly and Accessible
Declarative language
Efficient database management
Standard language
command structure
built-in functionality

Classification of SQL commands-
DDL  DML DCL TCL DQL
create- To Create a new table -CREATE TABLE table_name (id, name , salary ,email) ;
drop - To delete table
alter - To chnange structure of table
truncate - To 
WHERE - To filter records based on conditions

Example: Creating a Table in SQL using DDL:

CREATE TABLE students(             Column name  Data type Constraints
  student_id INT PRIMARY KEY,      student_id  INT PRIMARY KEY
  name VARCHAR(100),
  age INT,
  gender VARCHAR(10),
  email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE,
  admission_date DATE);
Read data from table - SELECT * FROM table_name;
Delete table- DROP FROM TABLE table_name where id = 1

ALTER TABLE IN SQL : Modify table without deleting
ALTER TABLE students ADD contact_no VARCHAR(15); - To add a new column
ALTER TABLE students DROP COLUMN gender; - To delete a column 
ALTER TABLE students RENAME COLUMN name to full_name;- Renaming a Column in a Table

What is DROP TABLE in SQL? 
DROP TABLE table_name;
it will permanently remove the entire table from the database:
The table structure.
All data stored within
Any associated constrains, indexes,or triggers
This action is irreversible unless a abckup exists.

Difference between DELETE ,TRUNCATE, DROP
Use: To delete specific rows from a table based on a given condition.
Commands: 
DELETE FROM students where age < 18;
TRUNCATE TABLE students; 
DROP TABLE students;

Table after Execution: The table & its structure remains unchanged.
Quickly delete all rows from a table while preserving the struture for future use.
Completely remove a table: including its structure,data & all associated constraints

What are the Data Types in SQL?
Types of SQL Data Types :
Numeric Data Types = 10
Character/String Data Types - "John"
Date and Time Data Types -
Boolean Data Types - Yes/No or True/False  TRU, FALSE

Data Type      use for                      Example
INT            Whole numbers                15, 200, 999
BIGINT         very large numbers           9876543210
SMALLINT       smaller number               1,2,3
DECIMAL(p,s)   Exact numbers(with decimal)  12.50
FLOAT          Approximate decimal values   3.14, 0.99


Liminations of DDL:
No data Handling
Irreversible in Some Cases
Limited to Schema-Level Changes
Requires Permission
Error-Prone for Beginners
No Confrmatio Prompts
