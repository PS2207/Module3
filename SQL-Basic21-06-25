Understanding the Data Definition Language(DDL) :
Background & Origin:
SQl was developed at IBM by Donald D.Chamberlin and Raymond F.Boyace after learning about the relational model from Edgar F.chatCodd in the early 1970s.
The language was originally named SEQUEL(Structured English Query Language)
WHat is SQL?

Visual Representation of SQl as the Bridge Between DBMS aand Data   DBMS->SQL->Data

How SQL interacts with Data in a DBMS?
Why is SQL Important?
User friendly and Accessible
Declarative language
Efficient database management
Standard language
command structure
built-in functionality
#--------------------------------
1.DDL SYNATX-
SHOW databases;
CREATE DATABASE db_name;
USE db_name;
DROP database db_name; / DROP table table_name;
CREATE TABLE students(id INT PRIMARY KEY, name VARCHAR(100), age INT, email VARCHAR(100), gender VARCHAR(10), UNIQUE, admission_date DATE ); 
ALTER TABLE table_name ADD email VARCHAR(100) unique;   ALTER TABLE students DROP column email;
Ex- ALTER TABLE students ADD(age INT, email varchar(100) UNIQUE);  ALTER TABLE students  DROP COLUMN age,DROP column email;
RENAME TABLE table_name TO new_table_name;  ALTER TABLE table_name RENAME column st_id TO std_id;
TRUNCATE TABLE table_name;
#-----
2.DML(Data Manipulation Lnaguage) :-
INSERT into students (id,name,age,email,gender,admission_date) values(1, 'john', 30, 'm', 'john@gmail.com', 1-1-2000 );
UPDATE students SET age=30 WHERE id=1;
DELETE FROM students where id in(1,2);

This will update existing records or insert new ones.
MERGE- INSERT INTO students (id,name,age,email) values(1,'ram',35,'ram@gmail.com') ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE name=values(name), age=values(age),email=values(email);
CALL-
mysql>DELIMITER//
mysql>BEGIN
mysql>CREATE PROCEDURE getStudentById(IN stuId INT)
     >BEGIN
     >SELECT * FROM students WHERE st_id = stuId
     >END//
     >DELIMITER;
mysql>CALL getStudentById(2) 
What is the difference between simple query 'SELECT * FROM students WHERE st_id=2;' and 'Creating stored Procedure then Calling this'?
This directly fetches all columns from students table where id is 2O.
USE IT WHEN:
   You want to run a quick one-time query.
   You don't need to run this logic again & again.
This runs a stored procedure named getStudentById(2) which internally does- SELECT * FROM students WHERE stId=stuId;
USE IT WHEN:
    You need to reuse this query frequently.
    You want to make your app/database more secure and organized.
Create a stored procedure in MySQL that includes - IF condition, Input parameter, Message if no record found
GOAL- If Student with given id exist show their details.
If not, Show: 'No Student found with that id'
#------
DQL(Data Query Language) :-
SELECT * from students;  - (To See all rows and columns in a table)
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM students; -(Counts total number of rows in student table)
SELECT age,name FROM students WHERE age >30;  -(Fetch only specific column age,name students who is older than 30)
SELECT DISTINCT name FROM students;   -(Retrieves a list of unique(non-repeating) names from the students table and removes duplicate from the result)
SELECT * FROM students ORDER BY name desc;  -(Sorts results by the name column in descending (Z to A) order.
SELECT name,age, COUNT(*) FROM students GROUP BY name,age;  -(Counts how many students share the same name ,age)
#-----------------------------
Classification of SQL commands-
DDL  DML DCL TCL DQL
DDL Commands:-
CREATE- To Create a new table
DROP - To delete a table - DROP table students; DROP database iitmandi_db;
ALTER - To change structure of table(like adding column or removing column) - ALTER table students
TRUNCATE - To deletes all rows from a table but keeps its structure - TRUNCATE iitstudents;
RENAME- To rename a table or column - RENAME table students to iitstudents;

DML Commands:
INSERT
UPDATE-
DELETE-

WHERE - To filter records based on conditions

Example: Creating a Table in SQL using DDL:

CREATE TABLE students(             Column name  Data type Constraints
  student_id INT PRIMARY KEY,      student_id  INT PRIMARY KEY
  name VARCHAR(100),
  age INT,
  gender VARCHAR(10),
  email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE,
  admission_date DATE);
Read data from table - SELECT * FROM table_name;
Delete table- DROP FROM TABLE table_name where id = 1

ALTER TABLE IN SQL : Modify table without deleting
ALTER TABLE students ADD contact_no VARCHAR(15); - To add a new column
ALTER TABLE students DROP COLUMN gender; - To delete a column 
ALTER TABLE students RENAME COLUMN name to full_name;- Renaming a Column in a Table

What is DROP TABLE in SQL? 
DROP TABLE table_name;
it will permanently remove the entire table from the database:
The table structure.
All data stored within
Any associated constrains, indexes,or triggers
This action is irreversible unless a abckup exists.

Difference between DELETE ,TRUNCATE, DROP
Use: To delete specific rows from a table based on a given condition.
Commands: 
DELETE FROM students where age < 18;
TRUNCATE TABLE students; 
DROP TABLE students;

Table after Execution: The table & its structure remains unchanged.
Quickly delete all rows from a table while preserving the struture for future use.
Completely remove a table: including its structure,data & all associated constraints
#--------------------------------------

What are the Data Types in SQL?
Types of SQL Data Types :
Numeric Data Types = 10
Character/String Data Types - "John"
Date and Time Data Types -
Boolean Data Types - Yes/No or True/False  TRU, FALSE

Data Type      use for                      Example
INT            Whole numbers                15, 200, 999
BIGINT         very large numbers           9876543210
SMALLINT       smaller number               1,2,3
DECIMAL(p,s)   Exact numbers(with decimal)  12.50
FLOAT          Approximate decimal values   3.14, 0.99


Liminations of DDL:
No data Handling
Irreversible in Some Cases
Limited to Schema-Level Changes
Requires Permission
Error-Prone for Beginners
No Confrmatio Prompts
