What is Data Integrity & Transactions in DBMS 
Why it needed
What are constraints in DBMS? 
Why are constraints needed?
What are keys in database?
What is Primary key? uniquly identify ,cannot be null, can be candidate key(more than one candidate key like sudent id,phonem)
Foreign key? references to primary key of another table.
Candidate key?can be null
Alternative key?
composite key?
Super key?
Can enroll_date be a Proimary key
Which of the following is a candidate key in the enrollment table?
Write query to find names of students who have not enrolled in any course?
What is a transaction in DBMS? sequence of operation insert,delete,update
COMMIT -> Save changes permanently.
ROLLBACK -> Undo all changes since the transaction began.
There is a situation, when 1st update occurs, 2nd update doesn't occur.
so in that case, it might be an inconsistency.
Example of a Transaction
START  TRANSACTION
 1.DEDUCT RS1000 from Account A
 2.Add RS1000 to Account B
BEGIN;
UPDATE Accounts SET balance=balance - 1000 WHERE acc_no= 'A';
UPDATE Accounts SET balance=balance + 1000 WHERE acc_no= 'B';
COMIT: 
ROLLBACK;

BEGIN TRANSACTION;
INSERT INTO Accounts(acc_id,name,balance)
VALUES(103 'Charlie', 8000);
COMIT;//LETS SAY NO ERROR OCCURS
ROLLBACK; // logic error

BEGIN TRANSACTION;
DELTEE FROM Accounts WHERE acc_id=102;
COMMIT;
ACID Properties of Transactions
Atomacity
C-Consistency
I-Isolation
D-Durabiliy

Suppose Rah

START TRANSACTION;
UPDATE 
UPDATE
COMMMIT;
