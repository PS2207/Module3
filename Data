csv file storing customer records 
Difference between Flat File Database & DBMS
Simple ,Single table system    Complex, Multiple table sysem
Need of data in Database system:
Data -As a corporate resource:
Data Availability:
Maintaining Complex data:
Data independence and efficient access.
Data integrity security
Concurrent access ,recovery from crashes.

Benefits of Database System over File System :-
Redundency can be reduced   Inconsistency can be avoided

Data can beshared
Security restrictions can be applied
integrity can be maintained

Database Architecture:
External View 1    External View2

Why Database?
A typical file processing system suffers from some major liminations like:
Data redudency,


Types of Databases: (1)Hierarchical and Network   (2)Relational and Object-oriented  (3)Graph and ER Model  (4)Document Database

Database Abstraction: simplifies database design.

The major purpose of database system is to provide users with an abstract view of the system.

The system hides certain details of how data is stored, created, maintained. 
Complexity should be hidden from database users.

Three level of Abstractions are:
1.Internal Level(Physical Level): How data is stored
2.External Level: defines a number of simplified domain-specific views
3.Conceptual Level: defines data in terms of a data model
