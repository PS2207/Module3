What is Data?
*Raw facts, figures or information, that has no meaning until processed or organized.
Data can be numbers ,words, symbols.
Examples Of Data : 200, john, math (It does not contain any clear meaning,or doesn't give any kind of information)
But Symbols are count as data ,if they have context pass@123, Grade- A+, Currency- 50$
These values alone don't tell us much-  they are just pieces of information without context.

What is Information?
*Processed or Organized data, that has meaning and helps us understand something.
Information is useful for taking decisions or solving problem.
Example of Information : John scored 90 marks in Math, Employee1 is on leave today.

What is Database?
Database is a collection of related data items stored at one place.
Eg- College database stores information about teachers,students,classes,subjects(all related data).
A database is nothing but set of data having some relation between them.

Sample Database Structure:
Student Table:    Sid   Name  Class Major
Course Table:     Cid   Name  Hours
Department Table: Did   Name
Marks Table:      Sid   Cid   Marks Grade

Database Management System(DBMS):
DBMS is a software that helps in defining, constructing, manipulating the database.
suppose you have a data & you store data in a database. how you will access,how you modify, how you change any kind of 
it is also known as computerized record-kepping system.
DBMS have become an integral part of information system of many organisations as it is used to handle huge amount of data.

What is a Flat File Database?
A flat file database is a simple way to store data
csv file storing customer records 
Difference between Flat File Database & DBMS
Simple ,Single table system    Complex, Multiple table sysem
Need of data in Database system:
Data -As a corporate resource:
Data Availability:
Maintaining Complex data:
Data independence and efficient access.
Data integrity security
Concurrent access ,recovery from crashes.

Benefits of Database System over File System :-
Redundency can be reduced   Inconsistency can be avoided

Data can beshared
Security restrictions can be applied
integrity can be maintained

Why Database?
A typical file processing system suffers from some major liminations like:
Data redudency,


Types of Databases: (1)Hierarchical and Network   (2)Relational and Object-oriented  (3)Graph and ER Model  (4)Document Database

Database Abstraction: simplifies database design.

The major purpose of database system is to provide users with an abstract view of the system.

The system hides certain details of how data is stored, created, maintained. 
Complexity should be hidden from database users.

Three level of Abstractions are:
1.Internal Level(Physical Level): How data is stored
2.External Level: defines a number of simplified domain-specific views
3.Conceptual Level: defines data in terms of a data model
view1   view2----- view3
  CONCEPTUAL LEVEL   
  PHYSICAL LEVEL

Data Independence :

2 kinds of Data Independence:
Logical Data Independence :

Physical Data Independence:

Data Models:
3 types of Data Model-
(i)Hierarchical (ii)Relational
