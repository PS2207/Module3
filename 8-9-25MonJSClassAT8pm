Higher Order Function(HOFs):Is a function which takes another function as an argument or it returns a function.
Callback functions: They are functions that are passed as arguments in another function to be called later.
function fun(boo, x){
  boo(x)
}
function boo(num){
    consosle.log(num)
}
fun(boo, 3)

//Inbuilt HOF in JS
//forEach
let arr = [1,2,3,4,5]
function double(num){
  console.log(num*2)
}
double(10)
